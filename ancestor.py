""" 2. Build graph
-nodes: parents /child
-edges: relationship between parent/child
-directed: parent can only be parent, child can only be child
-acyclic
- node on avg connected to more than 1/2 other nodes?: sparse
- DFS- find the farthest relationship/path

Given the dataset and the ID of an
individual in the dataset, returns their earliest known
ancestor – the one at the farthest distance from the input
individual.

If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest",
return the one with the lowest numeric ID.

If the input individual has no parents, the function should
return -1.

#if vertext has no more neighbors


Assuming a bit more memory usage is not a problem and if the first
item of your tuple is hashable, you can create a dict out of your
list of tuples and then looking up the
value is as simple as looking up a key from the dict

^ if has children, it is in ancester[tuple#][0]
^ if has parent it is in ancester[tuple#][1], if start is not in ancester[i][1], has no parent
^ track through list to check of parent has parent
^ once parent no longer has parent, return that vertex, thats the farthest ancestor

^ Extra:count the number of times its in ancester[i][1] == number of ancestors
